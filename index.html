          In the 2020-2021 school year, nearly 7 out of 10 students across
          U.S. high schools had access to a stand-alone personal finance
          course. Of these students, about 2.4M (30%) of them were required to
          take the course prior to graduation

                  11,752,118 high school students nationwide. The most recent
                  NCES data estimates that there are 15,400,000 high school
                  students in the U.S. today. Therefore, NGPF’s data captures
                  76.3% of public high school students in the U.S.

                  Source: 77.8% of school level data is from Dr. Carly Urban and
                  her research team’s latest study (2021) at Montana State
                  University. The remaining 22.2% of school level data is from
                  teacher reported data to NGPF, previous years of research from
                  Dr. Carly Urban, and/or data collected as part of NGPF’s grant
