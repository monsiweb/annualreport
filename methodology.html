                  The data behind the report reflects 11,049 high schools and
                  11,752,118 high school students nationwide. The most recent
                  NCES data estimates that there are 15,400,000 high school
                  students in the U.S. today. Therefore, NGPF’s data captures
                  76.3% of public high school students in the U.S.

                  Source: 77.8% of school level data is from Dr. Carly Urban and
                  her research team’s latest study (2021) at Montana State
                  University. The remaining 22.2% of school level data is from
                  teacher reported data to NGPF, previous years of research from
                  Dr. Carly Urban, and/or data collected as part of NGPF’s grant
                  and research programs

                  All ‘gold standard school’ data includes current gold standard
                  schools as well as FUTURE gold standard schools. These are
                  schools that have proven their intent to guarantee a course.

                  A ‘guarantee’ state indicates those with state-wide personal
                  finance graduation requirements. Currently, NGPF recognizes 5
                  states (AL, MO, TN, UT, VA) as ‘guarantee’ states and 2 states
                  (NC, MS) as future ‘guarantee’ states as they have begun to
                  transition schools
